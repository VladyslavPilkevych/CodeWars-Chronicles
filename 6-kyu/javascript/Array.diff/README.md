# Kata: [\[Array.diff\]](https://www.codewars.com/kata/523f5d21c841566fde000009)

**Rank:** 6-kyu

## Problem Description
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

### Example

```javascript
arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
