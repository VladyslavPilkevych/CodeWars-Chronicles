# Kata: [\[Simple number triangle\]](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a906c895084d7ed740000c2/train/javascript)

**Rank:** 6-kyu

Consider the number triangle below, in which each number is equal to the number above plus the number to the left. If there is no number above, assume it's a `0`.

```
1
1 1
1 2 2
1 3 5 5
1 4 9 14 14
```

The triangle has 5 rows and the sum of the last row is `sum([1,4,9,14,14]) = 42`.

You will be given an integer n and your task will be to return the `sum` of the last row of a triangle of `n` rows.

In the example above:

`solve(5) = 42`
More examples in test cases. Good luck!

### Note

This kata uses native arbitrary precision integer numbers ( `BigInt`, `1n` ).
Unfortunately, the testing framework and even native `JSON` do not fully support them yet.
`console.log(1n)` and `(1n).toString()` work and can be used for debugging.
